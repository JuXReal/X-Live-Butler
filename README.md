# X-Live-Butler
The X Live Buttler processes Multirack&amp;Multifiles recordings of the X-Live Card (or similar cards).   The individual 4 GB files are disassembled.  Tracks without a useful signal are discarded. Several files belonging to one track are puzzled together. So that in the end you only have clean tracks for your DAW.
